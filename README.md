## Overview

This repository is nothing more than a proof of concept using Coq's Extraction,
BuckleScript, Rollup, Terser, and Closure Compiler to generate safe and fast
JavaScript.

### What is Coq

> Coq is a proof assistant. It means that it is designed to develop mathematical
> proofs, and especially to write formal specifications, programs and proofs
> that programs comply to their specifications. An interesting additional
> feature of Coq is that it can automatically extract executable programs from
> specifications, as either Objective Caml or Haskell source code. -
> [A short introduction to Coq](https://coq.inria.fr)

### What is BuckleScript

> BuckleScript isn't a new language. It simply takes OCaml, a fast, pragmatic
> and typed language, and makes it compile to clean, readable and performant
> JavaScript code. -
> [What is BuckleScript?](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/what-why)

### Source code

```coq
Fixpoint f n :=
  match n with
  | O => nat
  | S n => nat -> (f n)
  end.

Definition sigma: forall n, f n.
  intro n; induction n; simpl.
    exact O.
  intro m.
  destruct n; simpl in *.
    exact m.
  intro o.
  apply IHn.
  exact (m+o).
Defined.
```

### Generated codes

`sigma.ml`

```ocaml
type __ = Obj.t
type nat = O | S of nat

(** val add : nat -> nat -> nat **)

let rec add n m = match n with O -> m | S p -> S (add p m)

type f = __

(** val sigma : nat -> f **)

let rec sigma = function
  | O -> Obj.magic O
  | S n0 ->
      Obj.magic (fun m ->
          match n0 with
          | O -> m
          | S _ -> fun o -> Obj.magic sigma n0 (add (Obj.magic m) o))
```

`sigma.mli`

```ocaml
type __ = Obj.t
type nat = O | S of nat

val add : nat -> nat -> nat

type f = __

val sigma : nat -> f
```

`sigma.js`

```javascript
import * as Curry from "rescript/lib/es6/curry.js";

function add(n, m) {
  if (n) {
    return /* S */ {
      _0: add(n._0, m),
    };
  } else {
    return m;
  }
}

function sigma(n0) {
  if (!n0) {
    return /* O */ 0;
  }
  var n0$1 = n0._0;
  return function (m) {
    if (n0$1) {
      return function (o) {
        return Curry._1(sigma(n0$1), add(m, o));
      };
    } else {
      return m;
    }
  };
}

export { add, sigma };
```
